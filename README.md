# Homework4

<p>In this assignment I was tasked to create a timed multiple choice quiz. The user should be prompted when they choose a correct or worng answer. A wrong answer will reduce their score by 10 seconds. When the user completes the quiz they are asked to enter their initials to store their score. In the header the text hihhscore is a link to the highscores page which you can return to the quiz or clear scores.</p>

<p>You can access the quiz by clicking the link below:</p>

<p>Unfortunately I had to switch my methods late in the assignment, which caused me not to be able to finish completely before final submission time. I will continue to work on it in the meantime. Thanks!</p>
